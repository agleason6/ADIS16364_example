Interfacing ADIS16364 with Arduino
====================================
This software package is an example of how to interface an ADIS16364 iSensor with an Arduino Mega 2560.

What you'll need
----------------
- Arduino Mega 2560
- ADIS16364 with breakout board
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE
- Python with modules below, I tested this on Python 2.7
    + pySerial python module, see http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/
    + NumPy python module, see http://numpy.scipy.org/ 
    + SciPy python module, see http://www.scipy.org/
    + matplotlib python module, see http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

Connections
------------
Using jumper wires, make connections from the ADIS16364 breakout board to the Arduino
as shown below:

CS   (J1-3)  - to digital pin 53 (SS)
SCLK (J1-2)  - to digital pin 52 (SCK)
DOUT (J1-4)  - to digital pin 50 (MISO)
DIN  (J1-6)  - to digital pin 51 (MOSI)
VCC  (J1-12) - to 5V
GND  (J1-9)  - to GND 

See ADIS16364 datasheet Rev D, Figure 18, pg 17 for illustration of J1 and J2 connectors


How to use 
----------
Once you've installed everything above, and made all the proper connections, it's time to
program the Arduino. First open up the ADIS164364_example.ino file with the Arduino IDE. 
Press verify, and upload (after which you have properly setup the IDE with serial port, and device).
Now close the IDE, because you will probably have issues with the python plotting if you have both 
programs trying to access the same serial port.

Plotting data with Python
-------------------------
Using the script plot_data.py, you have to excecute it with the following command line options:

python plot_data.py -p <port> -r <baud rate>  

I haven't tested this on windows yet, but once I figure it out I will update this.

For example, to run this on linux:

python plot_data.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 -r 115200  

or if you like bar graphs better:

python plot_data.py --bar -p /dev/ttyACM0 -r 115200
